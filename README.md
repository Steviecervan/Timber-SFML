# Timber SFML
 "Timber" recreated in C++ and SFML

 I'm sharpening my C++ skills by learning a Multimedia Library, SFML. The book I am learning from is "Beginning C++ Game Programming: Learn C++ from scratch by building fun games" by John Horton. 
 
 This respository contains my revamped C++ code and art from the original code in the book.
